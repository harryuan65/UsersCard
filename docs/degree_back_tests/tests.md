## Rotation Adjustment

Recorded some desired rotation arrangment based on images.length.

### Experimenting

I wanted the first image to be either on the left or top. So I forced --rotate-apply-adjustment to 1 and was constantly changing --rotate-adjustment in the browser to find the desired modification.
